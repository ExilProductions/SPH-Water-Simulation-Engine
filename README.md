# SPH Water Simulation Engine

The **SPH Water Simulation Engine** is a high-performance fluid simulation engine built using C++ and CMake. It employs Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate realistic fluid dynamics, making it ideal for physics-based simulations, games, and research projects.

## Features

- **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)**: Utilizes SPH for accurate and realistic fluid simulation.
- **High Performance**: Optimized C++ implementation for real-time applications.
- **Customizable**: Modular design to easily integrate into larger projects or adapt for specific requirements.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with CMake for easy compilation on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started
